<strong>Question 1</strong>
This question focuses on the implementation of the Pascal Triangle. This triangle is one of the most most fascinating as in it, you can 
find other series such as the Fibonacci, Triangular numbers and tetrahedral numbers. 
I used the logic from the Binomial Expansion in mathematics of nCr : n!/(r! * (n-r)!)
For each row iterating through the values in the range from 0 to row number, I can create a pascal triangle
Currently, the program took over 5 minutes to compute the Pascal triangle with an input of n=1000.
